- ✅ Created mock navigation component

## ❌ **Firebase Blockers - 89 tests**

| File | Tests | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|
| `chat_page_test.dart` | 20 | Firebase initialization required |
| `friends_list_page_test.dart` | 24 | Firebase initialization required |
| `friend_search_page_test.dart` | 22 | Firebase initialization required |
| `location_history_page_test.dart` | 23 | Firebase initialization required |

**Error Pattern:**
```
[core/no-app] No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created - call Firebase.initializeApp()
```

## 🚀 **Cách chạy tests**

### All Working Tests (67 tests):
```bash
# Service tests (36 tests)
flutter test test/services/

# Page tests (31 tests)  
flutter test test/pages/login_page_test.dart test/pages/signup_page_test.dart test/pages/forgot_password_page_test.dart test/pages/main_navigation_page_test.dart

# All working tests
flutter test test/services/ test/pages/login_page_test.dart test/pages/signup_page_test.dart test/pages/forgot_password_page_test.dart test/pages/main_navigation_page_test.dart
```

### Individual Tests:
```bash
# Specific service
flutter test test/services/auth_service_test.dart

# Specific page
flutter test test/pages/login_page_test.dart
```

## 📈 **Test Coverage Details**

### Business Logic Coverage (Services): **100%**
- ✅ Authentication flows
- ✅ Chat messaging 
- ✅ Friend management
- ✅ Location services
- ✅ Location history

### UI Coverage (Pages): **36%**
- ✅ Authentication pages (login, signup, forgot password)
- ✅ Navigation structure  
- ❌ Complex pages requiring Firebase integration

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Firebase Pages**

1. **Setup Firebase Test Environment**
   ```dart
   // Mock Firebase initialization
   await Firebase.initializeApp(
     options: const FirebaseOptions(
       apiKey: 'mock-key',
       appId: 'mock-app-id', 
       messagingSenderId: 'mock-sender-id',
       projectId: 'mock-project-id',
     ),
   );
   ```

2. **Create Firebase Mocks**
   - Mock Firebase Auth
   - Mock Firebase Realtime Database
   - Mock Firebase Storage

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Use `integration_test` package for E2E testing
   - Test with real Firebase in test environment

## 🏆 **Achievement Summary**

**✅ What Works:**
- Complete service layer testing (36 tests)
- Core UI authentication flow (31 tests)
- Dependency injection architecture
- Mock generation and interfaces

**🔄 What's Next:**
- Firebase integration for remaining 89 tests
- E2E integration testing
- Performance testing

**📊 Current Success Rate: 43% (67/156 tests)**
